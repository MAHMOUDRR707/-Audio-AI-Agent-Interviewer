        "Technical Techniques": {
            "final_score": 18,
            "justification": "The candidate showed knowledge of various preprocessing methods, including mean/median imputation, regression imputation, and multiple imputation, as well as data normalization and feature scaling."
        },
        "Business Considerations": {
            "final_score": 14,
            "justification": "The candidate understood the importance of considering the impact of missing data on business outcomes and the need to balance data quality with analysis timelines, but could have provided more specific examples of how to communicate data quality issues to stakeholders."
        }
    },
    "recommendation": "The candidate demonstrates a strong foundation in data preprocessing techniques and a good understanding of the business implications of data quality. With some additional practice in communicating technical concepts to non-technical stakeholders, the candidate would be well-suited for a role involving data analysis and preprocessing.",
    "key_observations": [
        "Strengths: systematic approach to handling missing data, knowledge of preprocessing methods",
        "Areas for improvement: communicating data quality issues to stakeholders"
    ],
    "Best Response": "To clean and preprocess a dataset with missing values, I would first identify the type and cause of missingness, then select appropriate imputation methods based on the data distribution and analysis goals. I would also consider data normalization and feature scaling to ensure that the data is in a suitable format for analysis. Throughout the process, I would balance data quality with analysis timelines and communicate any data quality issues to stakeholders.",
