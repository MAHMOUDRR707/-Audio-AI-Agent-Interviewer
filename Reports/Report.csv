0,What is the difference between underfitting and overfitting?,6.0,"Underfitting occurs when a model is too simple and fails to capture the underlying patterns in the training data, resulting in poor performance on both the training and test sets. Overfitting, on the other hand, occurs when a model is too complex and fits the noise in the training data, resulting in good performance on the training set but poor performance on the test set.",Underfitting and overfitting is a common problem that machine learning engineers face especially when they are training their
1,You are given a dataset with missing values. How would you clean and preprocess the data before using it for analysis?,16.0,"To clean and preprocess a dataset with missing values, I would first identify the type and cause of missingness, then select appropriate imputation methods based on the data distribution and analysis goals. I would also consider data normalization and feature scaling to ensure that the data is in a suitable format for analysis. Throughout the process, I would balance data quality with analysis timelines and communicate any data quality issues to stakeholders.","The second question about pre-processing, I need to make some different steps before"
