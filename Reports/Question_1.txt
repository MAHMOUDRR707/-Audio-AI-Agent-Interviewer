            "justification": "The candidate starts to address the topic of underfitting and overfitting, but the response is incomplete and lacks specific definitions or explanations of the concepts."
    },
    "recommendation": "More information is needed to fully assess the candidate's understanding of underfitting and overfitting",
    "key_observations": [
        "The candidate recognizes underfitting and overfitting as a common problem in machine learning",
        "The candidate fails to provide precise definitions or explanations of underfitting and overfitting"
    ],
    "Best Response": "Underfitting occurs when a model is too simple and fails to capture the underlying patterns in the training data, resulting in poor performance on both the training and test sets. Overfitting, on the other hand, occurs when a model is too complex and fits the noise in the training data, resulting in good performance on the training set but poor performance on the test set.",
